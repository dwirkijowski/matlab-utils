Data Analysis Tools for Matlab based on a data table class

This package contains:
* a "Table" class for processing and exploration of numerical and categorical variables. 
The Table class encapsulates data array together with row names, column names, table name. 
It also supports factor columns, such as categorical factors ("yes", "no"), and overrides many plot functions.
* Pca and Anova classes that encapsulate algorithms for principal component analysis or analysis of variance, 
and provide intuituve methods for exploring and analysing the result while keeping individual or variable names.
